Hello everyone, I'm **Srikanth Thella**, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to explore my project. My passion lies in data analytics and visualization, particularly in the realm of Power BI. Through this project, I've undertaken three pivotal tasks:
1) Call trend Analysis
2) Customer Retention strategies
3) Fostering diversity and inclusion initiatives

Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, along with advanced Data analytics techniques, I've delved deep into the company's data to derive actionable insights. I've poured my creativity, dedication, and expertise into every aspect, and I'm excited to share the results with you. So, without further delay, let's dive in and discover together the insights and innovations waiting to be uncovered.

We aim to build innovative technology solutions that differentiate us from our competitors and digitise the business. Part of that included a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programmes so our people could learn how to use digital tools for data visualisation as well as automation, data cleansing and more.

If our people could use these tools to solve common problems, they’d help us become more efficient and growth-oriented now and more innovative later in Business Services and beyond. Now, employees are learning to build bots – over 2,400 have been created so far – to automate workflows. We continue to invest to make processes more intuitive using machine learning, PowerBI and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). These are key to working faster and solving problems differently for ourselves and our clients.

This is why you're here! Our Digital Accelerator programme is an internal chance that takes groups of our employees out of their day jobs and puts them through trainings that teaches them skills in technology such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is an important part of it as visualising data helps to handle and understand clients.

## Task 1: Call Centre Trends

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include:

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Task 2: Customer Retention
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

## Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

number of men
number of women
number of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women
